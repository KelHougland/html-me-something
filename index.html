                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>Andrew and Kelly have known each other for almost 30 years. While they have toyed with the idea of making games since adolescence, it wasn't until 2014 that they set out to actually put pen to paper.</p>
                    <p>Kelly had left the area for graduate school, and Andrew's first child was fully into toddlerhood. After taking a course on designing educational games, Kelly remembered their love of games and signed them up for a local game jam. The results of which you can download below.</p>
                    <p>Several years, many trashed designs, and mind numbing amount of playtests later, our valiant heroes are just about ready to get their games into the marketplace.</p>
