                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>While Circuitous is our only game currently for sale, it is one of the newer games we have had in development. It was developed for the 2015 Scatterjam at the St. Louis Zoo, where the theme was "Connections." It was polished up with feedback at Grandcon of 2016, and we got to show it off at Pixelpop 2016.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>                        
                            <p>One of the first games we worked on had the working title of "Zombietime!" It was a card based zombie survival game that we worked on for seemingly countless hours in 2014, only to see a very similar game beat us to market to great success.</p>
                        </li>
                
                        <li>
                            <p>HenchManagement was born in response to a GreaterThanGames contest. It was born as "Bidding: The Bidding Game." Over the course of the next year, it was renamed and, thanks to great feedback received at Grandcon 2016, greatly improved.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Dungeon Delving for Dollars is actually one of the games we have worked on the hardest and longest. There are a lot of dungeon crawl games out there, so it had to be unique and stand out. In addition, the nature of the game requires more balancing and development time than a card game like Circuitous.</p>

                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>Andrew and Kelly have known each other for almost 30 years. While they have toyed with the idea of making games since adolescence, it wasn't until 2014 that they set out to actually put pen to paper.</p>
                    <p>Kelly had left the area for graduate school, and Andrew's first child was fully into toddlerhood. After taking a course on designing educational games, Kelly remembered their love of games and signed them up for a local game jam and they developed Pogopainter, a simple paperboy-esque game about avoiding obstacles while painting a fence.</p>
                        <p> Upon returning to graduate school, Kelly used the absurd amount of time spent in manditory seminars and meetings to draft ideas and work out some basics of game design.
                    </p>
                    <p>Several years, many trashed designs, and mind numbing amount of playtests later, our valiant heroes are just about ready to get their games into the marketplace.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Look for us at Unpub Midwest in Grand Rapids Michigan the weekend of Nov. 3, 2017</p>
